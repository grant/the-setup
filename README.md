# the-setup
The ultimate frontend setup. A bootstrap for all my frontend project.

## Features
- React
- HMR
- Radium

## Development
```sh
yarn
npm start
```

## Open
```sh
npm run open
```

## Philosophy
- Most parts of a UI should be compartmentalized:
  - Just like npm modules, React Components (and more generically, JSX) can also be split into their own packages
